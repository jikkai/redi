# Contributing to Redi

Welcome to contribute to this project!

Please submit issues and pull requests to fix bugs or improve the documentation.
If you would like to add a new feature, that's fantastic, but please open an
issue first to discuss it because I want to keep the library simple :)

## Contributing code

### Code Style

I have set up lint-staged and CI to ensure that the code style is consistent.
Please make sure that your CI passes.

### Tests

Unit tests are required for all new features and bug fixes. Please ensure that
all tests pass before submitting a pull request. You can run the tests with:

```bash
pnpm test
```

I also suggest to install the recommended VS Code extensions to have a better
debugging experience.
