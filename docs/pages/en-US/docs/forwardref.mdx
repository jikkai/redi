# forwardRef

In the following example, `Person` is defined before `Father` but relies on `Father`. In this case, you should use `forwardRef` to wrap `Father`. Otherwise redi would receive `undefined` when tries to figure out dependencies of `Person` (and it would throw an error in that case).

```ts highlight=5
import { Self, SkipSelf, Optional } from "@wendellhu/redi";

class Person {
  constructor(
    @SkipSelf() @Optional(forwardRef(() => Father)) readonly father: Father,
  ) { }
}

class Father extends Person {
  changeDiaper(): void { }
}

const parentInjector = new Injector([[Person], [Father, { useFactory: f => f, deps: [Person] }]])
const injector = parentInjector.createChild([[Person]]);
const person = injector.get(Person);
expect(person.father).toBe(parentInjector.get(Person)); // true
```

  This is not related to redi itself but how TypeScript is transpiled into
  JavaScript.
